# OctoPrint-Lcd1602

PYTHON3

This plug-in allows you to control a 16X2 lcd display (hd44780 connected to port I2C) to display the octoprint status. It is useful for people like me who have a printer without a display.
It indicates on which port the printer is connected, the progress of printing. It also displays the remaining print time (thanks to a simple method).

  Notes: This plugin as written did not support Python 3 (Current default in OctoPrint)
  Modified to support Python 3, removed refrences to fakePi that were causing the plugin to fail to load.
